<i>Daily hijab style tips and tricks to level up your fashion game</i>	
<ol>
	<li><b>Skip the Pinning Step</b></li>
	<br>Pick a long rectangular scarf, wrap it around your head and throw one end of the scarf to one side of 
	<br>the shoulder. Make sure that the scarf is long enough to create the desired look and would not fall 
	<br>apart with time.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Vibrant Hued Scarf</b></li>
	<br>Make your casual look bright and appealing with some intricately printed scarfs. This fashion trick goes 
	<br>perfectly with the modern day settings and casual events. The colour of the outfit and the scarf should 
	<br>be in perfect sync with each other so that you can give your best shot in conventional dressing while 
	<br>looking equally stylish too.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Accessorising is a Key</b></li>
	<br>One of the best hijab fashion tips is to use a piece of attractive head jewellery and style it accurately. 
	<br>Be a piece of necklace, headband, a pair of earrings or a pretty handbag; a tiny add-on can give an 
	<br>edge to your modest appearance and make it awe-inspiring.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Style with Glasses</b></li>
	<br>While wearing cute glasses, make sure that you wrap your scarf loosely around the head and tuck it 
	<br>neatly to ensure the best fashionable look. Funky frames are the next big thing in the world of fashion 
	<br>and are what ruling all over the hearts of the modern fashionistas.

<i>How to care for your hijab</i>

<i>Hair care for hijabi</i>
<ol>
	<li><b>Dry your hair first</b></li>
	<br>You shouldn’t tie your hair when it’s wet as wet hair is prone to breaking. Always allow your hair to 
	<br>dry naturally. Use a blow-dryer sparingly.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Don’t tie your hair tightly</b></li>
	<br>It’s best to tie your hair a little looser so as not to strain the roots of the hair from constantly being 
	<br>pulled back.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Let your hair down </b></li>
	<br>When at home let your hair loose. Open up your hair, take out the hair tie, and run your fingers 
	<br>through the hair and gently massage scalp to get some circulation going.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Give you hair a weekly treat</b></li>
	<br>Use hair mask, hair conditioner, hair serums, and oils. Give some treatment to your hair to let it rest 
	<br>from being under hijab most of the time. 
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Don’t wash your hair everyday</b></li>
	<br>Scarves protect hair from the damaging UV rays as well as various environmental pollutants. 
	<br>Therefore, we don’t need to wash/shampoo our hair on a daily basis. However, do wash your hair if it 
	<br>became oily.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Wash under-caps regularly</b></li>
	<br>Our hair releases oil and dead cells which sticks to the under-cap. Make it a habit to regularly wash 
	<br>your under-caps since these are in direct contact with the hair for several hours each day.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Wear the right type of scarf</b></li>
	<br>It is preferred to wear scarf of breathable fabrics such as cotton, chiffon or silk. Not only are these 
	<br>fabrics light, they also will not make your head feel heavy or suffocated.

<i>Getting starts on wearing hijab</i>
<ol>
	<li><b>Wear it for the sake of Allah (SWT)</b></li>
	<br>Make the intention to wear the hijab for the sake of your creator. Always remember that Allah is your 
	<br>main supporter for the changes.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Make the decision to start</b></li>
	<br>Set a day and don’t back down from your decision. Ask Allah for strength, and remember the power 
	<br>of patience and faith.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Ignore the outside noise</b></li>
	<br>Remember, you won’t stop being yourself because of the outside noise. When you start wearing the 
	<br>hijab, you might come across a lot of judgment but remind yourself of your intention and why you are 
	<br>doing it.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Take it one day at a time</b></li>
	<br>Take baby steps when starting out. Try wearing the hijab when going out every other day and soon 
	<br>with the help of Allah (SWT) and patience, one day will turn into weeks, then months. Before you know 
	<br>it, your hijab will become second nature.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Work your way up to proper hijab</b></li>
	<br>You might choose to start wearing modest clothing first, such as long blouses or long coats, with long 
	<br>skirts until you are comfortable with wearing a headscarf as well. Once you are comfortable wearing 
	<br>modest clothing and a headscarf, you might be ready to wear the attire towards your proper hijab. 
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Give yourself a chance and have faith in Allah (SWT)</b></li>
	<br>No matter what anyone says, making the decision to start wearing hijab is between you and your 
	<br>Creator. You may stumble, you may even fall, but try and try again and you will reach your goal.
	<br><br>
	<li><b>Start with a friend</b></li>
	<br>It’s only natural for us to seek moral support, especially when embarking on a new journey. Starting 
	<br>this journey with a friend of family member will not only provide you with the support and motivation 
	<br>you need, but will increase you in rewards.
